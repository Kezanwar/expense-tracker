# expense-tracker (WIP)
An Expense Tracker built with ReactJS

DEV TO-DO LIST:

- Create graph section with toggle for monthly figures in chosen year using Chart.js
- Chain the iconAnimation (which is currently on a 10s loop) to the timeline of expense user input and submit
- Implement localStorage of expenses
- Back to front responsiveness across all devices
- Possibly look at reducing amount of gradient used in UI, cant decide if its overkill or not :D
- Create a Favicon (could use calendar thats in the date input, or a little piggy bank with the gradient?

TIDY UP CODE: 

- Remove all create-react-app unused boilerplate files
- Create Utility folder for helper functions
